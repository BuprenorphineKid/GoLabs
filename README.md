# GoLabs

Small golang shell project idea to keep me
interested. FAR from complete. but fun
nonetheless

I will be working on it diligently to 
improve my concurrency and reak world 
systems structure. 

TODO: 
	fix home/end special keys

	have insert styled screen representation of characters

	implement a toggled concurrently running debug mode 
	instead of having to press ctrl-D everytime you need stats

	generally add more features/commands

	more robust help command

in terms of everything else. you can contribute
or whatever just do your own thing. Im new
to github so i dont fully comprehend what 
public implies. though id love some &pointers
(lol), i plan on making it up and running on my
own first. then its in the air. 

So yeah, I write code in termux on Android 11
so do with that what you will and go easy on
me i just picked up go a little while ago.

lol
